Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The Client DriverPass was a company that wanted to create a system that would provide a study materials, reservations for one on one driving lessons, stay up to date with DMV regulations, in order to increase the passing rate of student drivers while being able to be accessed from a cloud based operating system. 

What did you do particularly well?
I think the part I did well was taking into account the needs of the client. Understanding exactly what the client wanted from the application. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One part that could use major improvement would be the Class Diagram from project 2. There are several key components missing from the diagram such as different users, and functionality that are completely missing. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I read the client transcript multiple times to make sure I didn't miss out on any functionality that the client wanted. It also helped me try to understand what it is the client wanted when reading it in their own words. This is important because the client is hiring you for a specific product with multiple specific needs, and if you are unable to complete the job, they will find someone who will. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software one step at a time. I like that this class started from the begininng of meeting with the client and figuring out their needs. I liked that each step built on eachother and even having to reflect one what limitations the software may have. I would definitley implement creating a process model to help the team get on the same page.
